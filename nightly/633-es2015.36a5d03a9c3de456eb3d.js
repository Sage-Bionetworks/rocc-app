This leaves patients struggling with a progressive loss of motor function while leaving cognitive functions intact. Symptoms usually do not manifest until the age of 50 but can start earlier. At any given time, approximately five out of every 100,000 people worldwide suffer from ALS, though there would be a higher prevalence if the disease did not progress so rapidly, leading to the death of the patient.\\n\\nThere are no known risk factors for developing ALS other than having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease, which accounts for about 5-10% of ALS patients. There is also no known cure for ALS. The only FDA-approved drug for the disease is Riluzole, which has been shown to prolong the life span of someone with ALS by a few months.\\n\\nThe average life span of an ALS patient is 2-5 years; however, approximately 10% of patients live significantly longer with a much slower disease progression. An example of the latter is astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who has lived with ALS for the last 49 years.\\n\\nThe DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life (or \u201cALS Prediction Prize\u201d for short) is based on the PRO-ACT database, which upon completion will contain clinical data for over 7,500 ALS patients from completed clinical trials. The entire PRO-ACT database will be available for research purposes in December 2012, and the ALS Prediction Prize will use a subset of this data. The challenge is being run by Prize4Life in collaboration with DREAM. Prize4Life is a non-profit organization whose mission is to accelerate the discovery of treatments and a cure for ALS by using powerful incentives to attract new people and drive innovation. Prize4Life is developing the PRO-ACT database in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) with funding from the ALS Therapy Alliance, and with generous data donations from both biopharma companies and academicians. Prize4Life shares DREAM\u2019s vision of scientific advancement through collaboration and open access challenges. Since it\u2019s founding in 2006, Prize4Life has run several ALS related challenges with prizes of up to a million dollars.

Human cancer cell lines represent a good model to help identify associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In recent years there have been several efforts to generate genomic profiles of collections of cell lines and to determine their response to panels of candidate therapeutic compounds. These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based either on the unperturbed genetic potential of a cancer cell, or by using perturbation data to incorporate knowledge of actual cell response. Making predictions from either of these data profiles will be beneficial in identifying single and combinatorial chemotherapeutic response in patients. To that end, the present challenge seeks computational methods, derived from the molecular profiling of cell lines both in a static state and in response to perturbation of a specific drug, that predict the sensitivity of the same or similar compounds in different cell lines. Methodology invoked in this challenge will be useful not only in therapeutic decision-making but also understanding the basic mechanisms of drug mode of action and drug-drug interaction.","startDate":"2012-06-01","endDate":"2012-10-01","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2785778","status":"closed","tagIds":["drug","drug-sensitivity","drug-synergy"],"organizers":[],"dataProviderIds":["oregon-health-and-science-university","columbia-university"],"grantIds":["Multiscale Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks"]},{"name":"NIEHS-NCATS-UNC Toxicogenetics","description":"This challenge is designed to build predictive models of cytotoxicity as mediated by exposure to environmental toxicants and drugs.

However, there is wide variation in the physiologic response to exposure at the individual level. Some people that are exposed to virus are able to completely avoid infection. Others contract virus but are able to fight it off without exhibiting any symptoms of illness such as coughing, sneezing, sore throat or fever. It is not well understood what characteristics may protect individuals from respiratory viral infection. These individual responses are likely influenced by multiple processes including both the basal state of the human host upon exposure and the dynamics of host immune response in the early hours immediately following exposure. Many of these processes play out in the peripheral blood through activation and recruitment of circulating immune cells. Global gene expression patterns measured in peripheral blood at the time of symptom onset - several days after viral exposure - are highly correlated with symptomatic manifestation of illness. However, these later-stage observations do not necessarily reflect the spectrum of early time point immune processes that predict eventual infection. Because signal amplitude is small at these early time points, the ability to detect early predictors of viral response has not yet been possible in any individual study. By combining data collected across 7 studies and leveraging the state-of-the-art in analytical algorithms, this Challenge aims to develop early predictors of susceptibility and contagiousness based on expression profiles that were collected prior to and at early time points prior to, and following viral exposure.","startDate":"2016-05-16","endDate":"2016-09-28","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn5647810","status":"closed","tagIds":["viral","respiratory-viral"],"organizers":[],"dataProviderIds":[],"grantIds":[]},{"name":"Disease Module Identification","description":"The Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge is an open community effort to systematically assess module identification methods on a panel of state-of-the-art genomic networks and leverage the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d to discover novel modules and pathways underlying complex d ...","summary":"The Disease Module Identification DREAM Challenge is an open community effort to systematically assess module identification methods on a panel of state-of-the-art genomic networks and leverage the \u201cwisdom of crowds\u201d to discover novel modules and pathways underlying complex diseases.","startDate":"2016-06-24","endDate":"2016-10-01","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6156761","status":"closed","tagIds":["module-identification"],"organizers":[{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Marbach","organizationIds":"university-of-lausanne"},{"firstName":"Sarvenaz","lastName":"Choobdar","organizationIds":"university-of-lausanne"},{"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Bergmann","organizationIds":"university-of-lausanne"},{"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lamparter","organizationIds":"university-of-lausanne"},{"firstName":"Zoltan","lastName":"Kutalik","organizationIds":"lausanne-university-hospital"},{"firstName":"Kasper","lastName":"Lage","organizationIds":"massachusetts-general-hospital"},{"firstName":"Thea","lastName":"Norman","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Christine","lastName":"Suver","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Friend","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Stolovitzky","organizationIds":"mount-sinai"},{"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Saez-Rodriguez","organizationIds":"heidelberg-university"},{"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Friend","organizationIds":"apple-health"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Stolovitzky","organizationIds":"ibm-research"},{"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Saez-Rodriguez","organizationIds":"european-bioinformatics-institute"},{"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Saez-Rodriguez","organizationIds":"rwth-aachen-university"}],"dataProviderIds":["university-of-lausanne"],"grantIds":[]},{"name":"ENCODE","description":"Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind specific DNA sequence patterns (motifs) in the genome and affect transcription rates of target genes.

Using these transcription datasets, participants will be asked to predict three different resistance states of a subset of the 55 in vitro isolate samples; 50% inhibitory concentration values (IC50), patient clearance half-life (PC1/2), and categorical resistance state (resistant/sensitive).","startDate":"2019-04-30","endDate":"2019-08-15","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn16924919","status":"closed","tagIds":["malaria"],"organizers":[{"firstName":"Michael T.","lastName":"Ferdig","organizationIds":"eck-institute-for-global-health"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Stolovitzky","organizationIds":"mount-sinai"},{"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Siwo","organizationIds":"center-for-research-computing"},{"firstName":"Sage","lastName":"Davis","organizationIds":"eck-institute-for-global-health"},{"firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Button-Simons","organizationIds":"eck-institute-for-global-health"},{"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Meyer","organizationIds":"ibm-research"},{"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Mulder","organizationIds":"h3abionet"},{"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Ghouila","organizationIds":"h3abionet"},{"firstName":"Sumir","lastName":"Panji","organizationIds":"h3abionet"},{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Yu","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Bletz","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Mason","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Stolovitzky","organizationIds":"ibm-research"},{"firstName":"Geoffrey","lastName":"Siwo","organizationIds":"eck-institute-for-global-health"}],"dataProviderIds":["texas-biomedical-research-institute","mahidol-oxford-tropical-medicine-research-unit","national-institutes-of-health"],"grantIds":[]},{"name":"Preterm Birth Prediction Challenge, Transcriptomics","description":"A basic need in pregnancy care is to establish gestational age, and inaccurate estimates may lead to unnecessary interventions and sub-optimal patient management.

One of the primary goals of this multi-center study was to develop a discovery cohort that could yield new drug target hypotheses and predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response. Patient samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES), transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), and ex-vivo functional drug sensitivity screens (Tyner et al. 2018)(www.vizome.org). This rich resource should enable the discovery of molecular correlates of drug response and putative patient populations most likely to respond to targeted agents.

Such approaches have been rolled out using research-grade wearable sensors and, increasingly, through the use of smartphones and consumer wearables, such as smart watches and fitness trackers. These devices not only provide the ability to measure much more detailed disease phenotypes but also provide the ability to follow patients longitudinally with much higher frequency than is possible through clinical exams. However, the conversion of sensor-based data streams into digital biomarkers is complex and no methodological standards have yet evolved to guide this process.\\n\\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the motor system but also exhibits other symptoms. Typical motor symptoms of the disease include tremors, slowness (bradykinesia), posture and walking perturbations, muscle rigidity and speech perturbations. Additionally, patients may experience side effects from their medication in the form of dyskinesia (involuntary movement). In the clinic, symptoms and side-effects are evaluated using physician observation and patient reports, however this infrequent assessment may not reflect a patient\'s typical state on an average day. Mobile sensor (accelerometers) may be useful for tracking a patient\'s symptom severity and response to medication, and have the potential to provide more detailed information that patients and physicians can use to make care decisions.\\n\\nWhile much work in this field has been done to predict symptom severity using sensor feeds during the completion of specific tasks, very little work has focused on information available from sensors worn during the course of daily living. The Biomarker and Endpoint Assessment to Track Parkinson\'s Disease (BEAT-PD) Challenge is a first of it\'s kind challenge, designed to benchmark methods for the processing of unstructured (free-living) sensor data, in order to be predictive of Parkinson\'s Disease severity.

Participants will be asked to use the provided post-treatment transcriptional data to predict drug sensitivity for 30 drugs across 515 cell-lines.","startDate":"2020-04-28","endDate":"2020-07-27","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21763589","status":"closed","tagIds":["panacea","drug","cancer"],"organizers":[{"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Califano","organizationIds":"columbia-university"},{"firstName":"Eugene","lastName":"Douglass","organizationIds":"columbia-university"},{"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Caescu","organizationIds":"columbia-university"},{"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Stolovitzky","organizationIds":"icahn-school-of-medicine-at-mount-sinai"},{"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Gerhard","organizationIds":"national-institutes-of-health"},{"firstName":"Julio","lastName":"Saez-Rodriguez","organizationIds":"heidelberg-university"},{"firstName":"Bence","lastName":"Szalai","organizationIds":"semmelweis-university"},{"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Allaway","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Guinney","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Julie","lastName":"Bletz","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Verena","lastName":"Chung","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Amy","lastName":"Truong","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Daniela","lastName":"Gerhard","organizationIds":"cancer-target-discovery-and-development"}],"dataProviderIds":["columbia-university"],"grantIds":[]},{"name":"EHR COVID-19","description":"The rapid rise of COVID-19 has challenged healthcare globally.

The underlying risks and outcomes of infection are still incompletely characterized even as the world surpasses 4 million infections. Due to the importance and emergent need for better understanding of the condition and the development of patient specific clinical risk scores and early warning tools, we have developed a platform to support testing analytic and machine learning hypotheses on clinical data without data sharing as a platform to rapidly discover and implement approaches for care. We have previously applied this approach in the successful EHR DREAM Challenge focusing on Patient Mortality Prediction with UW Medicine.\\n\\nWe have the goal of incorporating machine learning and predictive algorithms into clinical care and COVID-19 is an important and highly urgent challenge. In our first iteration, we will facilitate understanding risk factors that lead to a positive test utilizing electronic health recorded data mapped to the OMOP Common Data Model. Initially, UW Medicine clinical data sets will be used. If successful, we expect to expand this benchmarking effort to include methods for predicting trajectory and mortality as well as data from additional sites.","startDate":"2020-04-30","url":"https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn21849255","status":"open","tagIds":["covid","ehr"],"organizers":[{"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schaffter","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Yu","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Micheal","lastName":"Mason","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Yooree","lastName":"Chae","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Guinney","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Bergquist","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Yan","organizationIds":"sage-bionetworks"},{"firstName":"Justin","lastName":"Prosser","organizationIds":"university-of-washington"},{"firstName":"Sean","lastName":"Mooney","organizationIds":"university-of-washington"},{"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Bergquist","organizationIds":"university-of-washington"},{"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Yan","organizationIds":"university-of-washington"}],"dataProviderIds":["university-of-washington"],"grantIds":[]},{"name":"Anti-PD1 Response Prediction","description":"While durable responses and prolonged survival have been demonstrated in some lung cancer patients treated with immuno-oncology (I-O) anti-PD-1 therapy, there remains a need to improve the ability to predict which patients are more likely to receive benefit from treatment wit ...","summary":"While durable responses and prolonged survival have been demonstrated in some lung cancer patients treated with immuno-oncology (I-O) anti-PD-1 therapy, there remains a need to improve the ability to predict which patients are more likely to receive benefit from treatment with I-O.
