        "summary": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)–also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease (in the US) or Motor Neurone disease (outside the US)–is a fatal neurological disease causing death of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord which control voluntary muscle movements. This leaves patients struggling with a progressive loss of motor function while leaving cognitive functions intact. Symptoms usually do not manifest until the age of 50 but can start earlier. At any given time, approximately five out of every 100,000 people worldwide suffer from ALS, though there would be a higher prevalence if the disease did not progress so rapidly, leading to the death of the patient.\n\nThere are no known risk factors for developing ALS other than having a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease, which accounts for about 5-10% of ALS patients. There is also no known cure for ALS. The only FDA-approved drug for the disease is Riluzole, which has been shown to prolong the life span of someone with ALS by a few months.\n\nThe average life span of an ALS patient is 2-5 years; however, approximately 10% of patients live significantly longer with a much slower disease progression. An example of the latter is astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who has lived with ALS for the last 49 years.\n\nThe DREAM-Phil Bowen ALS Prediction Prize4Life (or “ALS Prediction Prize” for short) is based on the PRO-ACT database, which upon completion will contain clinical data for over 7,500 ALS patients from completed clinical trials. The entire PRO-ACT database will be available for research purposes in December 2012, and the ALS Prediction Prize will use a subset of this data. The challenge is being run by Prize4Life in collaboration with DREAM. Prize4Life is a non-profit organization whose mission is to accelerate the discovery of treatments and a cure for ALS by using powerful incentives to attract new people and drive innovation. Prize4Life is developing the PRO-ACT database in collaboration with the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) with funding from the ALS Therapy Alliance, and with generous data donations from both biopharma companies and academicians. Prize4Life shares DREAM’s vision of scientific advancement through collaboration and open access challenges. Since it’s founding in 2006, Prize4Life has run several ALS related challenges with prizes of up to a million dollars. For more information on Prize4Life please visit Prize4Life.org.",

        "summary": "Development of new cancer therapeutics currently requires a long and protracted process of experimentation and testing. Human cancer cell lines represent a good model to help identify associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In recent years there have been several efforts to generate genomic profiles of collections of cell lines and to determine their response to panels of candidate therapeutic compounds. These data provide the basis for the development of in silico models of sensitivity based either on the unperturbed genetic potential of a cancer cell, or by using perturbation data to incorporate knowledge of actual cell response. Making predictions from either of these data profiles will be beneficial in identifying single and combinatorial chemotherapeutic response in patients. To that end, the present challenge seeks computational methods, derived from the molecular profiling of cell lines both in a static state and in response to perturbation of a specific drug, that predict the sensitivity of the same or similar compounds in different cell lines. Methodology invoked in this challenge will be useful not only in therapeutic decision-making but also understanding the basic mechanisms of drug mode of action and drug-drug interaction.",

        "summary": "Respiratory viruses are highly infectious and cause acute illness in millions of people every year. However, there is wide variation in the physiologic response to exposure at the individual level. Some people that are exposed to virus are able to completely avoid infection. Others contract virus but are able to fight it off without exhibiting any symptoms of illness such as coughing, sneezing, sore throat or fever. It is not well understood what characteristics may protect individuals from respiratory viral infection. These individual responses are likely influenced by multiple processes including both the basal state of the human host upon exposure and the dynamics of host immune response in the early hours immediately following exposure. Many of these processes play out in the peripheral blood through activation and recruitment of circulating immune cells. Global gene expression patterns measured in peripheral blood at the time of symptom onset - several days after viral exposure - are highly correlated with symptomatic manifestation of illness. However, these later-stage observations do not necessarily reflect the spectrum of early time point immune processes that predict eventual infection. Because signal amplitude is small at these early time points, the ability to detect early predictors of viral response has not yet been possible in any individual study. By combining data collected across 7 studies and leveraging the state-of-the-art in analytical algorithms, this Challenge aims to develop early predictors of susceptibility and contagiousness based on expression profiles that were collected prior to and at early time points prior to, and following viral exposure.",

Binding sites of TFs differ across cell types and experimental conditions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is an experimental method that is commonly used to obtain the genome-wide binding profile of a TF of interest in a specific cell type/condition. However, profiling the binding landscape of every TF in every cell type/condition is infeasible due to constraints on cost, material and effort. Hence, accurate computational prediction of in vivo TF binding sites is critical to complement experimental results.",

        "summary": "Cancer is driven by aberrations in the genome [1,2], and these alterations manifest themselves largely in the changes in the structure and abundance of proteins, the main functional gene products. Hence, characterization and analyses of alterations in the proteome has the promise to shed light into cancer development and may improve development of both biomarkers and therapeutics. Measuring the proteome is very challenging, but recent rapid technology developments in mass spectrometry are enabling deep proteomics analysis [3]. Multiple initiatives have been launched to take advantage of this development to characterize the proteome of tumours, such as the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). These efforts hold the promise to revolutionize cancer research, but this will only be possible if the community develops computational tools powerful enough to extract the most information from the proteome, and to understand the association between genome, transcriptome and proteome in tumors.\n  \n To address this issue we have created a community-based collaborative competition: The NCI-CPTAC DREAM Proteogenomics Challenge. The challenge will use public and novel proteogenomic data generated by the CPTAC to try to answer fundamental questions about how different levels of biological signal relate to one another. In particular, we focus on understanding:\n \n Can one impute missing values in proteomics data given observed proteins?\n Can one predict abundance of any given protein from mRNA and genetic data?\n Can one predict the phosphoproteomic data, using proteomic, mRNA and genetic data?",

Of these, preterm birth (PTB), defined as giving birth prior to completion of 37 weeks of gestation, is the leading cause of newborn deaths and long-term complications including motor, cognitive, and behavioral impairment.

In spite of its relevance to many diseases, comprehensive studies on the heterogeneous signaling in single cells are still lacking.\n \n We have generated the, to our knowledge, currently largest single cell signaling dataset on a panel of 67 well-characterized breast cancer cell lines by mass cytometry (3’015 conditions, ~80 mio single cells, 38 markers; Bandura et al. 2009; Bendall et al., 2011; Bodenmiller et al., 2012; Lun et al., 2017; Lun et al., 2019). These cell lines are, among others, also characterized at the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic level (Marcotte et al., 2016).\n \n We ask the community to use these measurements to predict the signaling responses of the cell lines to drug treatment at the single-cell level. Firstly, we ask to predict certain markers in specific single cells. Secondly, we ask to predict the time-dependent response of single cells upon treatment with drugs. Finally, we aim to predict the time-dependent response of cell lines for which only static, unperturbed data is given.\n The methods developed to answer these questions will allow us to better understand the determinants that control single-cell signaling, the heterogeneity in drug response of cancer cells, and to push the limits of signaling modeling.",

This information can be recovered by computational tumor deconvolution methods, which would thus allow interrogation of immune subpopulations across the large collection of public bulk expression datasets.\n \n The goal of this Challenge is to evaluate the ability of computational methods to deconvolve bulk expression data, reflecting a mixture of cell types, into individual immune components. Methods will be assessed based on in vitro and in silico admixtures specifically generated for this Challenge.",

        "summary": "In the era of precision medicine, AML patients have few therapeutic options, with “7 + 3” induction chemotherapy having been the standard for decades (Bertoli et al. 2017). While several agents targeting the myeloid marker CD33 or alterations in FLT3 or IDH2 have demonstrated efficacy in patients (Wei and Tiong 2017), responses are uncertain in some populations (Castaigne et al. 2012) and relapse remains prevalent (Stone et al. 2017). These drugs highlight both the promise of targeted therapies in AML and the urgent need for additional treatment options that are tailored to more refined patient subpopulations in order to achieve durable responses.\n \n The BeatAML initiative was launched as a comprehensive study of the relationship between molecular alterations and ex-vivo drug sensitivity in patients with AML. One of the primary goals of this multi-center study was to develop a discovery cohort that could yield new drug target hypotheses and predictive biomarkers of therapeutic response. Patient samples were subjected to whole-exome sequencing (WES), transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), and ex-vivo functional drug sensitivity screens (Tyner et al. 2018)(www.vizome.org). This rich resource should enable the discovery of molecular correlates of drug response and putative patient populations most likely to respond to targeted agents. Indeed, analysis of these data has already revealed numerous correlations of drug sensitivity or resistance with a variety of mutational subsets of disease as well as numerous gene expression signatures that correlated with drug sensitivity/resistance (Tyner et al. 2018).\n \n The goal of this challenge is to define patient subpopulations tailored to individual treatments by discovering (genomic and transcriptomic) biomarkers of drug sensitivity, as evaluated on an unpublished cohort of patients from the BeatAML project.",

This means the data must be retrospectively harmonized and transformed to enable this data to be submitted. In addition, to be findable by the broader scientific community, coherent information (metadata) is necessary about the data fields and values. Coherent metadata annotation of the data fields and their values can enable computational data transformation, query, and analysis. Creation of this type of descriptive metadata can require biomedical expertise to determine the best annotations and thus is a time-consuming and manual task which is both an obstacle and a bottleneck in data sharing and submissions.\n \n Goal: Using structured biomedical data files, challenge participants will develop tools to semi-automate annotation of metadata fields and values, using available research data annotations (e.g. caDSR CDEs) as well as established terminologies and ontologies (e.g. NCIt, LOINC, Mondo, ICD).\n \n Motivation: We aim to significantly lower the burden of adding these annotations across the data ecosystem to streamline and enable both retrospective harmonization as well as data query, discovery and interpretation.

        "summary": "Recent advances in mobile health have demonstrated great potential to leverage sensor-based technologies for quantitative, remote monitoring of health and disease - particularly for diseases affecting motor function such as Parkinson’s disease. Such approaches have been rolled out using research-grade wearable sensors and, increasingly, through the use of smartphones and consumer wearables, such as smart watches and fitness trackers. These devices not only provide the ability to measure much more detailed disease phenotypes but also provide the ability to follow patients longitudinally with much higher frequency than is possible through clinical exams. However, the conversion of sensor-based data streams into digital biomarkers is complex and no methodological standards have yet evolved to guide this process.\n\nParkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the motor system but also exhibits other symptoms. Typical motor symptoms of the disease include tremors, slowness (bradykinesia), posture and walking perturbations, muscle rigidity and speech perturbations. Additionally, patients may experience side effects from their medication in the form of dyskinesia (involuntary movement). In the clinic, symptoms and side-effects are evaluated using physician observation and patient reports, however this infrequent assessment may not reflect a patient's typical state on an average day. Mobile sensor (accelerometers) may be useful for tracking a patient's symptom severity and response to medication, and have the potential to provide more detailed information that patients and physicians can use to make care decisions.\n\nWhile much work in this field has been done to predict symptom severity using sensor feeds during the completion of specific tasks, very little work has focused on information available from sensors worn during the course of daily living. The Biomarker and Endpoint Assessment to Track Parkinson's Disease (BEAT-PD) Challenge is a first of it's kind challenge, designed to benchmark methods for the processing of unstructured (free-living) sensor data, in order to be predictive of Parkinson's Disease severity. Participants will be provided with raw sensor (accelerometer and gyroscope) time series data recorded during the course of daily living, and will be asked to predict individuals' medication state and symptom severity.",
