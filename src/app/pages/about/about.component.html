        <h2>The ROCC Vision</h2>
        <p>The Challenge experience is currently cumbersome for all stakeholders involved. Participants encounter a huge
            pain-point in discovering Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find a streamlined
            solution to reaching a wide audience.</p>
        <p>The Registry of Community Challenges (ROCC) strives to address some of the friction in the Challenge
            experience by providing a centralized hub to reduce participant search cost and increasing Challenge
            visibility. Think of the ROCC like an EventBrite for the scientific benchmarking space!</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Sage Bionetworks strives to bridge the translational divide between biomedical research and clinical
            application by embracing open and reusable practices. One example is hosting scientific Challenges,
            galvanizing large communities of experts around new and complex biomedical problems. Aside from
            crowdsourcing biomedical problems, Challenges also seek to enable the robust assessment of tool performance
            (Ellrott, K., Buchanan, A., Creason, A. et al.)</p>
        <p>When done right, Challenges encourage innovation by promoting friendly competition to develop the best
            algorithms, evaluation with objective frameworks for assessment of these algorithms, and collaboration by
            bringing together new teams to uncover new insights. The Challenges ecosystem, however, is bottlenecked by
            the lack of a hub centralizing all biomedical challenges. Participants encounter a huge pain-point in
            discovering Challenges they are interested in, while Organizers struggle to find a streamlined solution to
            reaching a wide audience.</p>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>A successful Challenge requires both organizers and participants. While existing Challenge platforms like
            Synapse, Kaggle and EvalAI help connect organizers and participants and run challenges, the visibility of
            challenges is usually limited to the users of a specific challenge platform. The multiplication of challenge
            platforms and organizations leads to a lack of a central challenge hub that connects more widely users at
            the level of the entire biomedical community. We summarize our target users as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Challenge Participants</strong> are typically researchers or engineers. They want to solve
                challenging biomedical problems while building their professional reputation, and discover conference or
                Challenge opportunities to support both those aspirations.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenge Organizers</strong> are often Principal Investigators and researchers. They want to
                host a successful Challenge event, where a diverse network of researchers come together and spur
                innovation, without too much event overhead.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Challenge participants face the headache of finding relevant challenges, while Challenge organizers struggle
            with reaching the most wide and relevant audience. Here are the three biggest pain-points we hear from both
            sides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fragmented information ecosystem:</strong> over 25 organizations run biomedical challenges, each
                with their own website and social media channels (e.g: DREAM Challenges, CAFA, CAGI, MICCAI, TREC).</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of standardizations:</strong> each of those 25+ organizations lays out Challenge
                information differently, requiring organizers to repeatedly enter details on each site and introducing a
                poor search experience for participants (e.g: searching for “carcinoma” instead of “cancer” and getting
                zero results).</li>
            <li><strong>High overhead with Challenge promotion:</strong> Organizers face high cognitive overload due to
                the need to identify the owners of multiple communication channels (e.g. mailing lists and social media
                accounts) currently required to widely connect with the biomedical community.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>The ROCC aims to tackle each of these problems.</h4>
